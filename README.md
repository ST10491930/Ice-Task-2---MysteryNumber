 App Description:
 --This app was created to give a random number to the user and the user had to guess the right number. However during this process the app will continue to inform the user
   if their choosen number is correct or not. Once theyhave guessed the right number, the app will congadulate them and there will be an option for the user to restart the game.
   Other features that are included in the app are the attempts that will be shown to the user. The Development of the app was not completely done by us, however we did strive to learn the 
   code that we had found. We did however add a few new things, that being the restart button and changing the set value. 

   In conclusion, in the near future we hope to use the knowledge that we gained from this to develop our own application.
